# Haiku_questionnaire
This is a simple interactive questionnaire I developed as part of my thesis research, aimed at students of Japanese literature and culture in Japan.
The project is designed to collect responses related to haiku and user perceptions in an engaging and intuitive way. 

If you just want to see what happens you need to download all the files in the same folder (on your computer) and then execute the index.html one. 

Otherwise, if you want to try and edit the code, I suggest you to use [Codepen](https://codepen.io/trending), where you can edit all the files at the same time and see imeditely what happens to your interactive message.

You can also create a link to directly host the static webpage with the animation on GitHub, mine is https://livia020799.github.io/haiku_questionnaire/ (beta version with the japanese option under construction and still with just one haiku) 

Tutorial on how to create the link on GitHub:
1) Create an account on GitHub
2) Create a new repository
3) Upload the css, js and html files
4) Go to Settings > Pages
5) Select the main branch and click "Save"
6) Refresh the page or come back after a couple of minutes and on top of the "Pages" page you should find the link to your static Webpage

Please feel free to dm me for anything :)
